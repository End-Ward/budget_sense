Errors to FIX.

1. Upon entering a greater amount than the current balance in the add expense function it shows the Warning Dialog and also shows a snackbar the a new expense is added.
            The error here is that it should not show the new expense added because there is no expense that is added to the expense list.

2. Reference from the Error number 1. Upon launching the app and you haven't set the budget and you add funds. the same thing happens like in the number 1 error where the snackbar
   should not show because there are no funds that were added.

3. Again Reference from the first two errors. The snackbar shows together witht the warning dialog. It should not show because there is no expense that were added.
                                Overall the snackbar should not show when there is a warning dialog or the function is not made.

4. None so far


Changes MADE.
1. Removed the expense_list.dart since the function in that file is already present in the home_page.dart
2. Adjusted the font weight and sizes of the expense list for readability.
3. Adjusted the padding for the recent transactions card and the expense list items.
4. Changed the Date and Time format for easier understanding.
5. Changed the icon for darkmode




Good thing to have
1. Loading screen before the help and homepage shows.
2. After clearing the transactions it can be viewed on another page as History
3. A bar graph that shows your total expenditure for the last month or week.
4. Undo expense option or delete (this was a suggestion from other people)
5. An option that creates an excel file that can be exported (another suggestion)
